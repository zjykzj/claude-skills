# CLAUDE.md Authoring & Maintenance

Apply these principles when writing or modifying CLAUDE.md.

## Authoring Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Timeliness** | Update as code evolves — not write-once-and-forget |
| **Specificity** | Write `set connection timeout to 30s` not `configure reasonable timeout` |
| **High-frequency first** | Sort by usage frequency — most frequently referenced at top |
| **Single source** | Architecture hard constraints are authoritatively defined in `specs/modules/index.md`; CLAUDE.md references them |
| **Structure over length** | Target 300–700 lines; structure quality (Quick Reference, cross-references, categorized sections) matters more than line count. A well-structured 600-line file beats a dense 300-line file. |

## Recommended Structure

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Quick Reference (Read First) — critical rules, architecture summary, common tasks
## Project Overview
## Specifications — point to specs/, declare spec authority, CLAUDE.md vs specs boundary table
## Architecture — module dependency diagram, hard constraints, data flow pipeline
## Critical Implementation Details — most error-prone areas, with cross-references to related gotchas
## Development Commands — install, test, lint, manual verification
## Maestro Configuration — plugin-injected config (`{{VARIABLE}}` lines + version bump locations table); pure config, no prose
## Known Gotchas — categorized by topic with priority markers ([!]=critical, [*]=important)
## Test Structure
```

**Key patterns:**
- **Quick Reference**: 5-second scan for the most frequent actions. Distills ~600 lines into ~20. Always at the top.
- **Cross-references**: Critical Implementation Details link to related gotcha categories (`> **Related gotchas**: [Coordinate Systems](#coordinate-systems)`), and vice versa — bidirectional navigation.
- **Content boundary table**: A table in "Specs vs CLAUDE.md" showing what belongs where — prevents scope creep in both directions.

## Development Commands Section

Every CLAUDE.md **must** include a self-contained "Development Commands" section — concrete, runnable commands, never references to external skills. This replaces generic skill guidance with project-specific facts.

### Authoring Procedure

1. **Detect the toolchain** from the project, not from assumptions:
   - Python: `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py` present; lint stack via `grep -c "\[tool.ruff\]" pyproject.toml` (ruff stack) vs `black`+`isort`+`flake8` (legacy stack); type check via mypy (`[tool.mypy]` config)
   - Other ecosystems: use their native tools (npm test, cargo test, go test, etc.) — do not invent Python equivalents
2. **Check availability/config expectations** (`command -v <tool>`; which config file each tool reads — e.g. flake8 ignores pyproject.toml) and reflect any mismatch in the section (e.g. "flake8 defaults conflict with black — configure profile")
3. **Write the section** as a command table plus a run-everything one-liner:

```markdown
## Development Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pytest` | Run full test suite |
| `pytest -x -q` | Stop on first failure, quiet |
| `ruff check <src dirs>` | Lint |
| `ruff format --check <src dirs>` | Format check |
| `mypy <package>` | Type check |

Run all three: `pytest -q && ruff check <src dirs> && mypy <package>`

### Installation
pip install -e .[dev]                 # With test/lint deps
```

4. **Keep it factual**: commands that exist and pass today, not aspirational ones. Missing tool → note the install command, don't skip silently.
5. **No skill indirection**: the section stands alone — a developer without any skills installed can run the project's checks from this section alone.

## Maestro Configuration Section

The `## Maestro Configuration` section holds the plugin's injected configuration — **pure config, no prose**:

```markdown
## Maestro Configuration

{{AI_MODEL_NAME}} = DeepSeek-V4-Pro
{{AI_MODEL_EMAIL}} = noreply@deepseek.com
{{REPO_URL}} = https://github.com/owner/repo
{{PACKAGE_NAME}} = none

### Version Bump Locations

| # | File | Field |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | `VERSION` | `X.Y.Z` single line |
| 2 | `CHANGELOG.md` | `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section header |
```

- Shared variables are defined once at the section top (`{{AI_MODEL_NAME}}`/`{{AI_MODEL_EMAIL}}` are consumed by both commit and release); skill-specific content sits in fixed subsections.
- Each skill injects only its own lines on first use (Bootstrap); the section accumulates.
- `{{PACKAGE_NAME}} = none` for projects without a Python package.
- The section is inert without the plugin — never delete it, never mix prose into it.

## Known Gotchas Writing Guidelines

### Organization: Categorize, Then Prioritize

Instead of a flat numbered list, group gotchas by **topic** and mark each group with a **priority level**:

```markdown
## Known Gotchas

### [!] Coordinate Systems
N. **Item**: description + correct approach.

### [!] RLE & Encoding
N. **Item**: ...

### [*] COCO & Evaluation
N. **Item**: ...

### Visualizer Behavior  (no marker = reference)
N. **Item**: ...
```

| Marker | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[!]` | Critical | Causes silent bugs or crashes if missed |
| `[*]` | Important | Affects correctness or design decisions |
| *(none)* | Reference | Behavioral context, useful to know |

**Why categorize**: A flat list of 40+ items is unreadable. Topic groups let the reader jump to their area of concern. Priority markers let them know which items cannot be skipped.

### Entry Format

```
N. **Keyword**: problem description + correct approach.

Elements: scenario (in what operation) → wrong (common mistake) → correct (how to do it right) → reason (why)
```

Counter-example: `"Watch the encoding"` → unclear what to watch for.
Good example: `"DB connections: Use connection pool (min=5, max=20), never create per-request."` → scenario + mistake + fix + reason.

### Entry Sources

| Source | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Bug fixes | After each bug fix, ask: could a Gotcha have prevented this? Yes → add one |
| Onboarding | Every friction a newcomer hits is a potential Gotcha |
| Code review | Issue types repeatedly flagged in reviews |
| Architecture decisions | Constraints whose violation has severe consequences |

### Maintenance

- Sort by topic, then by frequency within each topic group
- Each Gotcha keeps bidirectional references with related specs / Critical Details (`> **Related gotchas**: ...` and `> **See also**: ...`)
- If a Gotcha's corresponding bug has been eliminated by an architecture refactor, delete it
- Categorization is the primary defense against long lists — 40+ items in ~10 topic groups is fine; a flat list of 40 is not
- Periodically review priority markers: `[*]` items that have caused recent bugs should be promoted to `[!]`

## Required Configuration

None — self-contained. Pure methodology, no project-specific variables.
